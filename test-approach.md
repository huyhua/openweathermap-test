# Test Approach

Because of the lacking of requirement, the test approach is a combination of both exploratory testing and coverage-based testing. The feature-under-test has a single flow, with the emphasis on the textbox used to search for city. Hence, most of the test cases will focus on validation check and boundary value analysis.

We assume that the feature backend is written using java.

## Scope
### In scope:
- The header search box
- The find page which displays results from the search box
- API endpoints used to get the city information.
### Out of scope
- The body search box
- The weather detail page

## Test Types
- Functional testing, by performing test cases based on business function.
- Usability testing, by testing on multiple browsers and screen size
- API testing, by verifying XHR to make sure data is handled correctly
- Security, by verifying for sql injections by automated penetration tools


## Defect Classification
|**Severity**|**Description**|
|------------|---------------|
|Critical|Defect causes critical loss of business functionality or a complete loss of service.|
|Major|Defect causes major impact to business functionality and there is not an interim workaround available.|
|Minor|Defect causes minor impact to business functionality and there is an interim workaround available.|
|Trivial|Defect is cosmetic only and usability is not impacted.|
