# Open weather map cypress tests

![Tests](https://github.com/huyhua/openweathermap-test/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)

This project is written using Cypress. For the best coding experience and correct style check please use `Visual Studio Code` to review.

The project is written in javascript using page object pattern. While cypress discourages the use of pageobject in favor of app actions, the use of pageobject is simply for demonstration purpose.

Repo is run using git workflows on every commit.
